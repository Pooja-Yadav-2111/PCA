# Principal-Component-Analysis-(PCA)
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used for feature reduction without losing its properties.
Basically, it describes the composition of variances and covariances through several linear combinations of the primary variables,
without missing an important part of the original information. In another term, it is about obtaining a unique set of orthogonal axes where the data has the largest variance.
Its main aim is to overcome the dimensionality of the problem. The reduction of dimensionality should be such that when dropping higher dimensions, the loss of data is minimum.
Also, the interpretation of principal components can explain associations among variables that are not visible at first glance.
It helps analyze the scattering of the observations and recognize the variables responsible for distribution.

#Context
Our client is an Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers now they need your help inbuilding a model to predict whether the 
policyholders (customers) from past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.
An insurance policy is an arrangement by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for specified loss, damage,illness, or death in return for the
payment of a specified premium. A premium is a sum of money that the customer needs to pay regularly to an insurance company for this guarantee. 
Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to
reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue. Now, in order to predict, whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, 
you have information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), Policy (Premium, sourcing channel) etc.
